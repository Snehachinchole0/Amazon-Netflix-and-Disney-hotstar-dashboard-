# Amazon-Netflix-and-Disney-hotstar-dashboard
It sounds like you're asking for information on creating a Power BI dashboard that integrates data from Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Disney+ Hotstar, and then uploading it to GitHub. Here's a step-by-step guide for this:

### **1. Project Overview:**
The goal is to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that presents data insights for multiple OTT platforms (Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar). This could include metrics such as:
- Subscriber growth
- User engagement
- Revenue trends
- Genre popularity
- Watch time across platforms

### **2. Data Collection:**
To build this dashboard, you will need datasets, which could include:
- Subscriber data over time (publicly available or synthetic datasets).
- Revenue data per platform.
- Watch time or content consumption by genre.
- Popular shows or movies across platforms.

If you don't have access to actual data, you can use publicly available datasets or generate synthetic data that mimics real-world patterns.

### **3. Power BI Dashboard Development:**

- **Data Import:** Use Power BI to import datasets. You can pull data from sources such as Excel, CSV, or an SQL database.
- **Data Modeling:** Ensure that the relationships between different datasets (e.g., revenue, watch time, subscribers) are correctly modeled. 
- **Visualization:**
  - Create visuals for subscriber growth trends using line charts.
  - Use bar charts for comparing popular genres.
  - Use stacked bar charts or pie charts to represent revenue distribution by OTT platforms.
  - Include slicers and filters to toggle between different OTT platforms and time periods.

- **KPIs:** Add key performance indicators to track metrics like:
  - Total subscribers per platform.
  - Monthly active users (MAUs).
  - Average watch time per user.
  - Top 5 most-watched shows or movies.

### **4. Uploading to GitHub:**

To upload your Power BI project to GitHub:
- **Export the Power BI File:**
  - Once the dashboard is complete, save it as a `.pbix` file.
  
- **Create a GitHub Repository:**
  - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository. Name it something relevant, e.g., "OTT-Platform-Dashboard-PowerBI."
  
- **Upload the `.pbix` File:**
  - Inside your repository, click on "Add file" and choose "Upload files." Upload your Power BI `.pbix` file here.
  
- **Documentation:**
  - Create a `README.md` file in the repository, explaining:
    - The purpose of the project.
    - The data sources used.
    - The insights that the dashboard provides.
    - How to use the dashboard.

### **5. Publish and Share:**
Once uploaded, share the repository link with others so they can download the `.pbix` file, explore the dashboard, or contribute to the project.
